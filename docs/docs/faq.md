**How were messy data issues handled?**
See [data_preparation_excel.md](./data_preparation_excel.md) for rules (nulls, duplicates, inconsistent labels, bad dates).


**What would you add next?**
Role-based views, SLA parameterization, trend decomposition, and automated refresh using OneDrive/SharePoint.
