# Dashboard Overview


**Purpose.** Provide a single view of security advisory health: progress against SLAs, risk exposure by severity, and operational bottlenecks.


**Audience.** Security governance leads, program managers, and team leads.


**Business questions answered**
1. How many advisories are open, and how many are overdue?
2. What proportion are High/Critical risk?
3. Where are we getting stuck (Blocked / long aging)?
4. Are specific assignees or business units over‑allocated?
5. Are we closing items within SLA across severities?


**Pages**
1. **Executive Summary** – KPIs (% Completed, % Overdue, Open Items, High/Critical mix) plus trend of closures vs creations.
2. **Risk & Lifecycle** – severity × status matrix, overdue by severity, blocked aging, due‑in‑next‑14‑days.
3. **Workload & Bottlenecks** – tasks by assignee, high‑risk assignments, longest‑open items, last‑updated heatmap.


**Interactions**
- Slicers: Project, Severity (Risk Label), Status, Assignee, Date range
- Tooltips: show Created, Due, Days Open/To Close, and SLA breach flag
